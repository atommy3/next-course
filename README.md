# ABOUT

This project was created by following the tutorial at https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app.

## Getting started

To create this project, I first created a vercel account.

Next, I installed pnpm with

```
$ npm install -g pnpm
```

Then, I ran

```
$ npx create-next-app@latest next-course-2 --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example" --use-pnpm
```

Which created this folder and all the starter files.
It also automatically created a git repository and the initial commit.

Finally, to install the project's dependencies, I ran

```
$ pnpm i
```

## How to run this project

In package.json, you should see a "scripts" property, which contains the options. The most relevant ones are:
- ``$ pnpm dev``, which runs the development server
- ``$ pnpm build``, which creates the production build

To log in, user the following credentials:
```
username: user@nextmail.com
password: 123456
```

The rest of this README.md was automatically generated when the project was created.
